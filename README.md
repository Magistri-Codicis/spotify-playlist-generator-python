# Spotify Playlist Generator

The Spotify Playlist Generator is a powerful Python application that allows users to quickly and easily create custom playlists based on their favorite artists. Simply provide a list of artists, specify the number of top tracks per artist to include, set the playlist name and description, and choose whether to shuffle the songs in the playlist. The application takes care of the rest, generating a new playlist that can be accessed directly in your Spotify account.

## Usage

To use the Spotify Playlist Generator, simply download the pre-built installer for Windows from the [release page](https://github.com/Magistri-Codicis/spotify-playlist-generator-python/releases), or build the project yourself with PyInstaller. Alternatively, you can run the `App.py` file directly after running the `start.bat` file, which installs all the required dependencies.

1. Provide a list of artists (comma-, semicolon-, or newline-separated).
2. Specify the number of top tracks per artist to include in the playlist.
3. Set the playlist name and description.
4. Choose whether to shuffle the songs in the playlist.
5. Click the "Generate Playlist" button to create the new playlist.
